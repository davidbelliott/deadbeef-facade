Cleaning the tire factory ain't easy. Snap, Crackle, Pop, and Ape Man are the big bosses, and they make the best tires. They made a tire called Big Bertha, and it was the biggest damn tire you'd ever seen.

[APE MAN]: Your task is simple. There are rats and fiends in this factory, dropping turds. You must exterminate while listening to tunes.

[APE MAN]: Take my Zune. Move to the beat without hitting the walls. Find the lift down to the next level.
